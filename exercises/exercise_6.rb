### Exercise 6: One-to-many association

# We haven't used the Employee class (and employees table) at all yet. 
# If you look at this table's column structure, 
# you'll find that it has a `store_id` (integer) column. 
# This is a column that identifies which store each employee belongs to. 
# It points to the `id` (integer) column of their store.

# Let's tell Active Record that these two tables are in fact related via the `store_id` column.

# 1. Add the following code _directly_ inside the Store model (class): `has_many :employees`
# 2. Add the following code directly inside the Employee model (class): `belongs_to :store`
# 3. Add some data into employees. Here's an example of one (note how it differs from how you create stores): 
# `@store1.employees.create(first_name: "Khurram", last_name: "Virani", hourly_rate: 60)`
# 4. Go ahead and create some more employees using the create method. 
# You can do this by making multiple calls to create (like you have before.) 
#   No need to assign the employees to variables though. 
#   Create them through the `@store#` instance variables that you defined in previous exercises. 
#   Create a bunch under `@store1` (Burnaby) and `@store2` (Richmond). Eg: `@store1.employees.create(...)`.

# Your code goes here ...
class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :store
end

class Store < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :employees
end

@store1.employees.create(first_name: "Khurram", last_name: "Virani", hourly_rate: 60)

@store1.employees.create(first_name: "Katty", last_name: "Mumbai", hourly_rate: 70)

@store2.employees.create(first_name: "Teddy", last_name: "Owen", hourly_rate: 60)
