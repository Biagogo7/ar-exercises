# 1. Use Active Record's `create` class method multiple times to create 3 
  # stores in the database:
#   * Burnaby (annual_revenue of 300000, carries men's and women's apparel)
#   * Richmond (annual_revenue of 1260000 carries women's apparel only)
#   * Gastown (annual_revenue of 190000 carries men's apparel only)
# 2. Output (`puts`) the number of the stores using ActiveRecord's `count` method, to ensure that there are three stores in the database.
